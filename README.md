25 minutes of focused work session.
5 minutes of short break session after each work session.
20 minutes of long break session after completing four work sessions.

**User Controls:**

Start Button: Initiates the timer for the work session.
Reset Button: Resets the timer to zero, allowing for a fresh start.

## Progress Tracking:

Check mark display after each completed work session to visualize progress and maintain motivation.
